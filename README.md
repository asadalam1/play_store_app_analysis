# play_store_app_analysis
Abstract:
The Google play store is one of the largest and most popular Android app store. A few thousands of new applications are regularly uploaded on Google play store. A huge number of developers working freely on designing the apps and making them successful. With the enormous challenge from everywhere throughout the globe, it is important for a developer to know whether he/she is continuing the correct way or not. The objective of this experiment is to deliver insights to understand customer demands better and thus help developers to popularize the product. We have tried to discover the relationships among various attributes such as which application is free or paid, what are the user reviews, rating of the application.


1.	PROBLEM STATEMENT
We were given two datasets, one with basic information and the other with user reviews data of respective applications. We will be doing Exploratory data analysis on this data set, which is a very important step in data science cycle, as it not only helps in taking very initial business decisions but also in preparing the data for further modelling for use in machine learning algorithms. Our objective will be to structure the data, clean it and present certain trends that we observe that can help us draw very preliminary conclusions about the probability of success of a newly launched app.  

2.	INTRODUCTION
Play store is an Android Market which serves as the official app store for devices running on the Android Operating system. Developed and Operated by Google, launched on 6th March, 2012. Approximately 3.48 million apps are in the Play store. Play store apps have their own features such as Ratings, Reviews, Size and more. From the problem statement given, we should analyze the given database and should come up with the key factors that increased the number of users, long term usage etc., the objective of this project is to deliver insights to understand customer demands better and thus help developers to popularize the product.

3.  DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
Data preprocessing and cleaning of raw data is the most important part of any data analysis to get more accurate insights. Preprocessing can help with completeness and comparability. For instance, you'll see if certain values were recorded or not. Also, you'll see how trustable the info is. It could also help with finding how consistent the values are. We need preprocessing because most real-world data contains inaccurate and invalid data. Data can also be uncertain i.e. there can be some missing values.
The available data are raw and unusable for   Exploratory data analysis, so before we do anything with the data we will have to explore and clean it to prepare it for data analysis.

Conclusion~
Through exploratory data analysis we have observed some trends and have made some assumptions that might lead to app success among the users in the play store:-
•	Majority of the apps in the Play Store is Free (~92%).
•	Family, Games, Tools, and Business Category holds the major chunk of apps in the Play Store.
•	Most competitive category is Family and Games.
•	Category of Apps getting installed the most is Games, Communication, and Tools.
•	Demands of the Communication Category apps is higher .
•	Lifestyle Category has generated the highest revenue through installs.
•	Percentage of apps with no age restriction is ~82%
•	Only 11% of apps are available for Teens but it accounts for 21% of total app installs.
•	Minecraft app has generated the highest revenue of ~69Million$ with over ~10Million installs. 
•	Average Rating of Paid apps is 4.2 and for Free apps is 4.1 .
•	Bulky apps are less installed by the user.
•	Majority of the apps in the Play Store are of size less than 20MB.
•	There is a strong positive correlation between Reviews and Installs.
•	Price is negatively correlated with Installs.
•	Majority of the apps (64.2%) in the Play Store is Positively Reviewed.
•	Sentiment Subjectivity is not correlated with Sentiment Polarity.
